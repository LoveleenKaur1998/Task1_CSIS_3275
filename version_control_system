This is the first assignment of Software Engineering.
This will help us to get familiar with Github. 
The version control system helps to keep the track of all modifications done by every user in a very special database.
It allow you to compare files, identify differences, and merge the changes if needed prior to committing any code. 
In all software development, any change can introduce new bugs on its own and new software can't be trusted until it's tested. 
So, testing and development proceed together until a new version is ready.
